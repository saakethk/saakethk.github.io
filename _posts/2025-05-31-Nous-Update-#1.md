This is the first weekly Nous update. I have built in basic functionality and narrowed down the purpose of the app. I have chosen to describe Nous as a financial-first social app that provides analyst level information in a beginner friendly manner. For the frontend, I have decided to use Next.js and Material UI. For the auth, I have used Clerk Auth. Currently, I have integrated Clerk Auth and handled the sign-in and layout of the app. Looking into the future, I need to bake in Firestore functionality for database management. After I do this, I plan to prioiritize working on the backend. I have added screenshots of the layout and login screen.
