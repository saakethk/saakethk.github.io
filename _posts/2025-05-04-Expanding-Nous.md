It has been a while since I have updated this blog. I wanted to dedicate myself to improving my coding knowledge and focusing on my time this summer on the items I have listed below.

I plan on splitting up Nous into two main parts: finance, and news. Essentially I will be able to address two major passions of mine as part of one project. I plan on breaking down both of these applications into smaller projects.

The long term vision for Nous Finance is for it to be a showcase of a profitable algorithmic trading algorithm which is able to generate consistent profits. The main essence of it will be based on my past year of research.

The long term vision for Nous News is for it to be a all-in-one platform which allows writers to publish news articles that are verified and allows readers to see articles and sources on an in-depth level.

Overall, this post is a way for me to express my personal commitment to working on these projects outlined. Starting May 16th, I dedicate myself to publishing atleast one post per week outlining the progress I have made on the projects outlined above.
