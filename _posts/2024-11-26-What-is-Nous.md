Nous is a project that I have been working on extensively for the past 4 months. I originally came up with the idea in 10th grade when I was in journalism. This class instilled within me a facination with the social aspect of sharing news.

As I delved into the news industry and how it functioned, I learned about the importance of keeping journalism alive. I realized that journalism was crucial to the government and that it helped to promote transparency. 

However, I also learned that present-day journalism doesn't always follow the strict guidelines and standard set by conventional news. This can be good but it can also be bad. Thats why I decided to create a social news platform that encouraged tracability because misinformation tends to develop as a lack of clear communication.

Currently, Nous only has basic functionality and is very limited but I plan to add numerous features like spotify integration, audio transcription, and a writing portal. I will continue to add articles about new features and updates about the product on this blog. The github for Nous is public at saakethk/nous-news. Comment down below if you want to see any specific features and thank you for reading this post.
